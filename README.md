 <p>
Software engineer skilled with using JavaScript with frameworks like React and Vue to create beautiful, dynamic user experiences and Express/Node.js to produce RESTful APIs. I am experienced with databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL. I have deployed applications utilizing Docker, Nginx, Redis, and AWS services such as S3 and EC2.

I find that having held multiple positions helps me, as a developer, to understand the big picture while working on projects and not only contribute directly with work produced, but also indirectly with guidance and direction. In my past life, I was a hotel manager at a 1,282 room luxury property in Las Vegas. When I am not programming, I enjoy riding motorcycles, traveling, camping, lifting, cooking, and playing video games with friends.

Please feel free to reach out to me any time. I'd love the opportunity to discuss anything related to technology or even our shared interests.
